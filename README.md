This project involves the design and implementation of a Single-Cycle MIPS Softcore Processor using Verilog HDL. The processor was developed with a RISC CPU architecture and verified through functional simulation using Icarus Verilog (iverilog). The design demonstrates the fundamental principles of instruction execution, datapath, and control unit integration in FPGA-based processor design.
